{"google":"","tagline":"A completely free diff/patch/merge library for text documents","name":"PyTextDiff","body":"PyFreeDiff\r\n==========\r\n\r\nPyTextDiff is a completely free and open source wrapper for Python's difflib that provides efficient  *diff*, *patch* and *merge* functionality.  PyTextDiff is different in that its main focus is on the versioning of text documents, where the traditional 'line by line' diffing approach is not desirable. Therefore it generates diffs on the basis of 'sentence parts'.\r\n\r\nIt is available as truly free and open source software under the permissive MIT license. There are no requirements for using the code in your own project, however if you do use this library, it would be really nice to know about it!\r\n\r\nCurrently PyTextDiff is in active development and hence not suitable for a production environment as some function names and behaviour is likely to change.\r\n\r\n\r\nFeatures\r\n========\r\n\r\nCurrently PyFreeDiff allows:\r\n - Generate diffs at sentence level\r\n - Apply patches to a file\r\n - Remove patches from a file\r\n\r\n\r\nRoadmap\r\n=========\r\n\r\nCurrently in development:\r\n - Three way merge\r\n\r\nUsage\r\n=====\r\n\r\nClone the repository to your local computer. \r\n\r\nA simple example usage may be as follows\r\n\r\n    from PyFreeDiff import PyFreeDiff\r\n\r\n    sd = PyFreeDiff()\r\n    t1 = \"This is a sample. Text of awesomeness. Can I patch it?\"\r\n    t2 = \"This is a sample.  Text of awesomeness.  Can I change it? Should I play it?  Can I patch it?\"\r\n    diffs = sd.diff(t1, t2)\r\n    t3 = sd.apply_patch(t1, diffs)\r\n    print t2\r\n    print t3\r\n    print t2 == t3\r\n\r\n    t4 = sd.remove_patch(t3, diffs)\r\n    print t4\r\n    print t1\r\n    print t4 == t1\r\n\r\n\r\nLicense\r\n=======\r\n\r\nThe MIT License (MIT)\r\nCopyright (c) 2012, William Hart\r\n\r\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of\r\nthis software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal in\r\nthe Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use,\r\ncopy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the\r\nSoftware, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so,\r\nsubject to the following conditions:\r\n\r\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all\r\ncopies or substantial portions of the Software.\r\n\r\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\r\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS\r\nFOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
