          <h1>PyFreeDiff</h1>

<p>PyTextDiff is a completely free and open source wrapper for Python's difflib that provides efficient  <em>diff</em>, <em>patch</em> and <em>merge</em> functionality.  PyTextDiff is different in that its main focus is on the versioning of text documents, where the traditional 'line by line' diffing approach is not desirable. Therefore it generates diffs on the basis of 'sentence parts'.</p>

<p>It is available as truly free and open source software under the permissive MIT license. There are no requirements for using the code in your own project, however if you do use this library, it would be really nice to know about it!</p>

<p>Currently PyTextDiff is in active development and hence not suitable for a production environment as some function names and behaviour is likely to change.</p>

<h1>Features</h1>

<p>Currently PyFreeDiff allows:</p>

<ul>
<li>Generate diffs at sentence level</li>
<li>Apply patches to a file</li>
<li>Remove patches from a file</li>
</ul><h1>Roadmap</h1>

<p>Currently in development:</p>

<ul>
<li>Three way merge</li>
</ul><h1>Usage</h1>

<p>Clone the repository to your local computer. </p>

<p>A simple example usage may be as follows</p>

<pre><code>from PyFreeDiff import PyFreeDiff

sd = PyFreeDiff()
t1 = "This is a sample. Text of awesomeness. Can I patch it?"
t2 = "This is a sample.  Text of awesomeness.  Can I change it? Should I play it?  Can I patch it?"
diffs = sd.diff(t1, t2)
t3 = sd.apply_patch(t1, diffs)
print t2
print t3
print t2 == t3

t4 = sd.remove_patch(t3, diffs)
print t4
print t1
print t4 == t1
</code></pre>
